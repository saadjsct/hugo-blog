"Organized religion" or "Institutional religion" is an important term used in the fields of religious studies and sociology as a classification for the set of religions that has the property of being organized or institutionalized (more on that later). but this term is often used loosly by many to include every major world religion, which is not only annoying, but it can be very harmful.

this loose usage of the word is so wide spread that it has found its way to many English dictionaries. for example the [meriam webster's definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/organized%20religion) of organized religion is:
> "a belief system that has large numbers of followers and a set of rules that must be followed".

but frankly you can't blame the dictionaries. a general dictionary is (and should be) descriptive by nature, not prescriptive. that is, it should only be concerned with how the words are used, not how they should be used. nevertheless, for the purpose of our discussion, those definitions provide for us an indication for how this popular usage of the word has gone far away from its formal usage.

One of the most significant reccurrent error resulting from such usage is the often inclusion of Islam in lists of organized religion. According to Wikipedia's [page on  religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion), 
>"Many world religions are also organized religions, most definitively including the Abrahamic religions Christianity, Islam, and Judaism."

which is *"most definively"* false. as I come across this kind of statements more and more, I am beginning to see a direct link between many aspects of the west's aproach to Islam and statments of this kind.

In this article I will try to objectivly look into what does it mean for a religion to be "organized" or "institutional", And why such classification is necessary for a religious discource free of false assumptions and wrong expectations from each other.
