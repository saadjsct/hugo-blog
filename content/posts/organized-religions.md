"Organized religion" or "Institutional religion" is an important term used in the fields of religious studies and sociology as a classification for the set of religions that has the property of being organized or institutionalized (more on that later). but this term is often used loosly by many to include every major world religion, which is not only annoying, but it can be very harmful.

this loose usage of the word is so wide spread that it has found its way to many English dictionaries. for example the [meriam webster's definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/organized%20religion) of organized religion is:
> "a belief system that has large numbers of followers and a set of rules that must be followed".

but frankly you can't blame the dictionaries. a general dictionary is (and should be) descriptive by nature, not prescriptive. that is, it should only be concerned with how the words are used, not how they should be used. but for the purpose of our discussion those definitions provide for us an evidence of how the popular usage of the word has gone far away from its formal usage.

The most significant reccurrent error resulting from this usage is the often inclusion of Islam in lists of organized religion. According to Wikipedia's [page on  religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion), 
>"Many world religions are also organized religions, most definitively including the Abrahamic religions Christianity, Islam, and Judaism."

which is *"most definively"* false. as I come across this kind of statements more and more, I am beginning to see a direct link between many aspects of the west's aproach to Islam and statments of this kind.

in this post I will try to objectivly look into what does it mean for a religion to be "organized" or "institutional", And why such classification is necessary for a religious discource free of false assumptions and wrong expectations from each other.

# defining Organized Religion

before we get into the "Organized" part of the problem, there is one simplification trick that is used in the field of linguistics and I think is very helpful to borrow in this context. that is the treatment of dialicts as a separate languages. this is a justified  all because there is no natural boundaries between languages, you can't objectively decide how far a dialict can deviate from a sibling before it must be treated as a different language.

In a similar fashion, for the purpose of this discussion only, I shall treat any closed bielef system as a unique religion, without any distinction between a sect, denomination, and religion. every citizen will get a first-class citizin treatment. so you will see terms like "the sunna religion", "the shia religion", "the baptists religion", "the catholic religion" and so on.

there is one last note that has to be adressed about this simplication before we can get to the meat of our case study, this denominational blindness does not hold us from grouping different religions into families based on certain commonalities, so we might group religions that believe in the Abrahamic call as the "Abrahamic family". some religions inside this family holds Jesus christ as their central figure, those we might call "the christian family", etc. what makes this different that the religion-denomination classifications is that  this grouping can be based on any arbitrarily chosen criteria as seen suitable for any specific analysis.

we we might speak about a big family as "Abrahamic family" and a smaller family within it that we might call the "christian fanily" devided into "protestant family" and "traditional christian family", etc. this is very different than the religion-denomination taxonomy, rather, it's a grouping of equal elements
