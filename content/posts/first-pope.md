# gradual development of the doctrine.

definition of a dogma can happen later in history, but this doesn't mean the dogma came to existance at that time. for example, it was defined in councel of trent that the scriptures are inerrent, but of cource it was inerrent all along. Jesus didn't become devine when the nicene creed defined the mystery of his devinity. 

## the seed form analogy
if someone looked into a seed and looked into the full grown tree. he can't see a connection between the two.
the full tree is latent in the seed. the tree is the natural growth of the seed, without any human intervention.


## the old church
the idea of the development of the doctrine has a strong analogy in the old testament we all know the centrality of the kingship of Juda by the house of david for isreal. The God's anointed to rule over all the tripes of isreal. The kingship that - by spiritual authority - defined the boundaries of the nation of God. you can see this clearly from the time of the schism of the isralite kingdom. even though Rehoboam (king of Judah) was a "bad" king and partially allowed for the "sin of Jeroboam" (king of the ten northern tripes), nevertheless, it's clear from the scriptures which side was God's side and which kingdom was his. at that time, it wasn't for the godliness of Judah and benjamin (the only tripe that stayed with Juda) that they were saved in God's promise, it was only for the dynasty of david, the one to whom the kingship was given. it was clear that he who was on Judah's side was on God's side. 


, one that directly mirrors the natural development of the papacy in the new church.

it took centuries for the old church to realize the kingship of God's anointed one over his promised land. if look at the first generations of the people of God in the promised land, there are only 12 tripes competing with each other without a king, it's basically a decentralized system of Judges competing with each other and everyone is doing what is right in their own eyes. if you look in the pentantuch and law, there wasn't even a mention of a necessity for a king, let a lone this significance of the kingship of david. 
but the book of Judges is describing the way the history in a way that can be only done retrospectivly. 
then there is saul 

the competing arguments against the house of david was based on the interpretation of moses

this is it.`
