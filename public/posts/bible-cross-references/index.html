But to fully unlock its beauty and the spiritual realities it depicts, we need firstly to translate those intersected lines into a human language.\nThe gray and white vertical bars on the lower horizontal axis denote chapters of the Bible books (starting from the left with Genesis 1). The first book of the Old and the New Testaments are colored white for a visual indication of where each testament starts. The length of each bar denotes the relative length of each corresponding chapter (for example the longest bar near the middle corresponds to Psalms 119, the longest chapter in the Bible).\nEach curved line represents a cross-reference between two verses (the references you see on page margins in your Bible). The color of each arc represents the distance between the referenced verses. For example, the pink arcs correspond to references between verses nearer to each other than the ones connected by green arcs.\nReading Between the Lines Now that we have decoded the graph, I want to share some quick observations that I personally find striking.\nStarting from the obvious, this is one of the strongest and most effective statements about the internal integrity of the Bible. You can’t find this kind of internal connections in any known system except in organic networks. This is actually what makes organic structures so distinct from any man-made system, that is, the overwhelming complexity of everything being connected to everything. so when Paul called the scriptures “living” in his epistle to the Hebrews in a context of heavy referencing to the Old Testament, I imagine he had something like this in his mind.\nNon-linearity Another structural property that is clear from the graph is the non-linearity of the scriptures. By non-linearity I mean that the progression of the book doesn’t move in a straight line, neither in time (chronologically) nor in abstraction (from the simpler to the more complex). Even if you haven’t read the Bible before, you can clearly see from a structural point of view of this graph that whatever this book is about, the beginnings are in the ends and the ends are in the beginnings. And you can’t fully understand the first chapter of the book without every other chapter.\nAbout the Subject Other than the structural information this graph provides, I claim it provides a tangible evidence for two important conclusions about Scriptures that directly fall from those structural properties.\nThe first is the unity of the subject. Again, even if you don’t know what this book is about, you certainly know from this kind of organic unity that it must have one clear subject from the first page to the last, otherwise this kind of immense referencing wouldn’t be possible.\nThe continuity of the biblical narrative This unity of the subject is so manifest in the fact that without the visual marking of the first book of the New Testament, you can’t tell from the intensity or distance of the cross-referencing where it starts and where the Old Testament ends. This has special significance in arguing against both modern Judaism and Dispensationalism, those who believe that the old Israel doesn’t continue in the church of the new covenant and that God maintains two different covenants with two different people with two different promises. It’s structurally evident that this is a book about one God, one people of God, one continuous progression without any breakage.\nAbout the Author The second conclusion is the oneness of the authorship. For this kind of unity to exist within a book, it’s not enough for it to be of one subject, it also has to be of one author. for who can put the ends in the beginnings except he himself who wrote the ends and the beginnings and had them both in his mind before the first written word.\nThe spiritual realities of the Bible If this was a screenplay or a novel, there would be nothing spiritual about such properties. A novel can be written non-linearly, can have one subject, and certainly can have one author (or a team of authors under one). But what is beyond the wildest imagination, what no one could ever fathom, is that this organic structure is a product of around 40 different authors over a period of 1,500 years. Who authored this book? Who can span more than a millennium overseeing this project? Who knew the ends in the beginnings and had it in his mind all along?\nlet’s see how the book itself answered those questions:\nFor no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. (2 Peter 1:21 ESV)\nIf there is a book that can be considered a living miracle, I don’t know what else would be!\n",
